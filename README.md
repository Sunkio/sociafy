# Sociafy

**Note:** This is a test project aimed at experimenting with Material UI components in a React application. It is intended for learning purposes and should not be used in a production environment.

Sociafy is a fictional social media web application where users can post images and descriptions, connect with others, and follow their activities. It provides a platform for users to share their moments and interact with one another. Although it bears similarities to social media platforms like Facebook, this project is purely a frontend implementation and does not include backend functionality. User data is hardcoded for simplicity.
